## On Artifact Uploaded

The On Artifact Uploaded trigger starts a workflow execution when an artifact is deployed to JFrog Artifactory.

### Configuration

- **Repository** (optional): Filter events to a specific repository. Leave empty to trigger for all repositories.

### Outputs

- **Default channel**: Emits artifact deploy data including repo, path, name, size, and sha256.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "artifact-1.0.jar",
    "path": "com/example/artifact-1.0.jar",
    "repo": "libs-release-local",
    "sha256": "abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz567",
    "size": 12345
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-23T12:00:00Z",
  "type": "jfrogArtifactory.artifactUploaded"
}
```

## Delete Artifact

The Delete Artifact component removes an artifact from a JFrog Artifactory repository.

### Use Cases

- **Cleanup pipelines**: Remove outdated or temporary artifacts after a release
- **Storage management**: Delete artifacts that are no longer needed
- **Automated housekeeping**: Trigger deletions based on workflow conditions

### Configuration

- **Repository**: Select the Artifactory repository containing the artifact
- **Path**: The path to the artifact within the repository (supports expressions)

### Output

Returns the repository and path of the deleted artifact.

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "path": "/com/example/artifact/1.0/artifact-1.0.jar",
    "repo": "libs-release-local"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-23T12:00:00Z",
  "type": "jfrogArtifactory.artifact.deleted"
}
```

## Get Artifact Info

The Get Artifact Info component retrieves metadata about an artifact stored in JFrog Artifactory.

### Use Cases

- **Artifact verification**: Check artifact existence and checksums before deployment
- **Pipeline metadata**: Retrieve artifact details for downstream workflow steps
- **Audit and tracking**: Get creation time, size, and author information

### Configuration

- **Repository**: Select the Artifactory repository containing the artifact
- **Path**: The path to the artifact within the repository (supports expressions)

### Output

Returns artifact metadata including repository, path, size, checksums, download URI, and timestamps.

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "checksums": {
      "md5": "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e",
