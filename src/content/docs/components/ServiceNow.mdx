Manage and react to incidents in ServiceNow

import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Actions

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Create Incident" href="#create-incident" description="Create a new incident in ServiceNow" />
  <LinkCard title="Get Incident" href="#get-incident" description="Fetch a single ServiceNow incident by selecting it from the dropdown" />
</CardGrid>

## Instructions

Requires a ServiceNow instance with OAuth API access.

Before creating OAuth credentials, enable client credentials grant on your instance:
- Go to **System Properties** (sys_properties_list.do) and search for:
  - **Name**: glide.oauth.inbound.client.credential.grant_type.enabled
  - (Important: the property name ends with **enabled**)
- If it does not exist, create it with:
  - **Application Scope**: Global
  - **Type**: true | false
  - **Value**: true

Then configure OAuth:
- Go to **System OAuth > Inbound Integrations**
- Create a new integration with **OAuth - Client Credentials Grant**
- Copy the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
- Assign required permissions to the integration account:
  - **itil** role (required for incident read/write)
  - Optionally **admin** if broader scoped access is needed
- Optionally enable **Web Service Access Only** on the integration account to restrict it to API-only use.

## Create Incident

The Create Incident component creates a new incident in ServiceNow using the Table API.

### Use Cases

- **Alert escalation**: Create incidents from monitoring alerts
- **Error tracking**: Automatically create incidents when errors are detected
- **Manual incident creation**: Create incidents from workflow events
- **Integration workflows**: Create incidents from external system events

### Required Permissions

The ServiceNow integration account needs:
- **itil** role — grants read/write access to the Incident table

### Configuration

- **Short Description**: A brief summary of the incident (required, supports expressions)
- **Description**: Detailed description of the incident (optional, supports expressions)
- **Urgency**: Incident urgency level (1-High, 2-Medium, 3-Low)
- **Impact**: Incident impact level (1-High, 2-Medium, 3-Low)
- **Category**: Incident category (select from list)
- **Subcategory**: Incident subcategory (depends on the selected category)
- **Assignment Group**: The group responsible for resolving the incident (select from list)
- **Assigned To**: The user assigned to resolve the incident (select from list)
- **Caller**: The user reporting the incident (select from list)

### Output

Returns the created incident object from the ServiceNow Table API, including:
- **sys_id**: Unique identifier
- **number**: Human-readable incident number (e.g. INC0010001)
- **state**: Current incident state
- **short_description**: Incident summary
- **created_on**: Creation timestamp
