SuperPlane can be installed in a few different ways depending on the
level of scale and operational control you need.

### Try it on your computer

Choose this if you want to quickly try SuperPlane on your local machine without
setting up cloud resources or Kubernetes.

- [Try it on your computer](/installation/local)

### Single-host installation

Choose this if you want a production-like setup without Kubernetes.
Single-host installs are simpler to operate and are ideal for smaller
teams or early deployments.
