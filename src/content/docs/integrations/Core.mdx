## Manual Run

Manually start a workflow from the SuperPlane interface, useful for testing, on-demand actions, or operator-initiated runs.

## Webhook

Start a run by sending an HTTP request to a unique webhook URL. This trigger lets external systems or services initiate a run in SuperPlane.

<ExampleOutput>
```json
{
  "body": {
    "event": "push",
    "repository": "superplanehq/superplane"
  },
  "headers": {
    "X-Event": [
      "push"
    ]
  }
}
```
</ExampleOutput>

## Schedule

Automatically start a run according to a schedule you define. This is useful for running tasks on a recurring basis (such as nightly builds, backups, periodic checks, or scheduled deployments) without manual intervention.

<ExampleOutput>
  ```json
  {
    "calendar": {
      "day": "1",
      "hour": "09",
      "minute": "00",
      "month": "January",
      "second": "00",
      "week_day": "Monday",
      "year": "2024"
    },
    "timezone": "+00:00"
  }
  ```
</ExampleOutput>

<a id="approval"></a>

## Approval

Pauses the run and waits for users to approve or reject before continuing. Most useful when manual oversight is required, such as for deploying to production or handling sensitive operations.

<ExampleOutput>
  ```json
  {
    "data": {
      "records": [
        {
          "approval": {
            "approvedAt": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
            "comment": "Looks good"
          },
          "index": 0,
          "state": "approved",
          "type": "user",
          "user": {
            "email": "alex@example.com",
            "id": "user_123",
            "name": "Alex Doe"
          }
        }
      ],
      "result": "approved"
    },
    "timestamp": "2026-01-16T17:56:16.680755501Z",
    "type": "approval.finished"
  }
  ```
</ExampleOutput>

## Filter

Filter only allows events that match your expression to pass through, letting you control which events continue in the pipeline.

<ExampleOutput>
  ```json
  {
    "data": {},
    "timestamp": "2026-01-16T17:56:16.680755501Z",
    "type": "filter.executed"
  }
  ```
</ExampleOutput>

## If

Evaluate a boolean expression to decide how to route each event.

<ExampleOutput>
  ```json
  {
    "data": {},
    "timestamp": "2026-01-16T17:56:16.680755501Z",
    "type": "if.executed"
  }
  ```
</ExampleOutput>

## HTTP Request

Send HTTP requests to external services or APIs and process their responses.

<ExampleOutput>
  ```json
  {
    "data": {
      "body": {
        "message": "ok"
      },
      "error": "Error to read request body: EOF",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": [
          "application/json"
        ]
      },
      "status": 200
    },
    "timestamp": "2026-01-16T17:56:16.680755501Z",
    "type": "http.request.finished"
  }
  ```
</ExampleOutput>

## Merge

Wait for and combine results from multiple upstream nodes before continuing with the run.  

Commonly used to synchronize parallel event streams, aggregate data from several sources, or ensure that several conditions are met before proceeding.

<ExampleOutput>
  ```json
  {
    "data": {
      "eventIDs": [
        "event_1",
        "event_2"
      ],
      "groupKey": "merge-group-123",
      "sources": [
        "node_a",
        "node_b"
      ],
      "stopEarly": false
    },
    "timestamp": "2026-01-16T17:56:16.680755501Z",
    "type": "merge.finished"
  }
  ```
</ExampleOutput>

## No Operation

Pass events through unchanged, performing no logic or transformation.  

<ExampleOutput>
  ```json
  {
    "data": {},
    "timestamp": "2026-01-16T17:56:16.680755501Z",
    "type": "noop.finished"
  }
  ```
</ExampleOutput>

## Time Gate

Route events based on time conditions - include or exclude specific time windows

<ExampleOutput>
  ```json
  {
    "data": {},
    "timestamp": "2026-01-16T17:56:16.680755501Z",
    "type": "timegate.finished"
  }
  ```
</ExampleOutput>

## Wait

Wait for a certain amount of time

<ExampleOutput>
  ```json
  {
    "data": {
      "actor": {
        "display_name": "Alex Doe",
        "email": "alex@example.com"
      },
      "finished_at": "2024-01-01T12:05:00Z",
      "reason": "timeout",
      "result": "completed",
      "started_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    },
    "timestamp": "2026-01-16T17:56:16.680755501Z",
    "type": "wait.finished"
  }
  ```
</ExampleOutput>
